This guide will walk you through the process of using a bridge between 2 Dijets blockchains, providing a step-by-step approach to ensure a smooth and secure experience.

Go to Dijets Bridge and connect any web3 wallet. Make sure your wallet has at least some DJT on the Lothar Testnet. If you need funds you can go to the [faucet](https://faucet.dijets.io).

Mint some `TST` token on `Utility Chain` in the Mint tab. This is an ERC20 deployed on Lothar's utility chain.
Finally bridge some `TST` to `Dispatch`. You can confirm the transfer in the Mint tab.
