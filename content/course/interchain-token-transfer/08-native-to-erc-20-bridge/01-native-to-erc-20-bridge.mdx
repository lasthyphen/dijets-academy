DITTO is also capable of bridging native tokens from Dijets ECCs to the Utility Chain as ERC-20 tokens. This process involves deploying a `NativeTokenHome` contract on the Dijets ECC, and a `ERC20TokenRemote` contract on the Utility Chain. The `NativeTokenHome` contract will be used to bridge the native token to the Utility Chain as an ERC-20 token.

This example will cover native to ERC-20 token bridging between `mydijetschain` and the Utility Chain, but the process can be adapted to bridge the Utility Chain's native asset, `DJT`, to any ECC as an ERC-20 token.

### What we will do
1. Deploy a Wrapped Native Token to `mydijetschain`
2. Deploy the `NativeTokenHome` contract on `mydijetschain`
3. Deploy the `ERC20TokenRemote` contract on the Utility Chain
4. Register `ERC20TokenRemote` on Utility Chain with `NativeTokenHome` on `mydijetschain`
4. Perform a transfer of the native token on `mydijetschain` to the Utility Chain as an ERC-20 token
