### Transfer the ECC's Native Token to the Utility Chain

Now that all the bridge contracts have been deployed and configured, send some native tokens from your Dijets ECC to Utility Chain with the [`cast send`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) foundry command.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url mydijetschain --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_BRIDGE_ECC \
"send((bytes32, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address))" \
"(${C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_C_CHAIN}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 0, 0, 250000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)"  --value 1ether
```
</Step>

### Check Balance
To confirm the token was bridged from Dijets ECC to Utility Chain, we will check the recipient's balance of wrapped tokens on the Utility Chain with the [`cast call`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-call?highlight=cast%20call#cast-call) foundry command:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url local-c $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_C_CHAIN "balanceOf(address)(uint)" $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```

```bash
1000000000000000000
```
**Success!** We have bridged 1 native token from our Dijets ECC to the Utility Chain as an ERC-20 token.
