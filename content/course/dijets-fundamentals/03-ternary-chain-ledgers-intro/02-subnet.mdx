Dijets ECC is a network with its own set of rules regarding membership, token economics, and execution layer. It is composed of a Subset of Dijets validators collaborating to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains. Validators can be members of numerous Dijets ECCs.

Dijets enables multiple interconnected Dijets ECCs. Each Dijets ECC is independent while maintaining the capacity to communicate with other Dijets ECCs. All validators are part of Dijets main network known as the Chief Network.

Each blockchain belongs to exactly one Dijets ECC, but Dijets ECC can validate many blockchains. Each blockchain can define its own Virtual Machine (EVM, customized EVM or entirely new VM). 

The tailored, application-specific blockchains of Dijets ECCs offer a solution to these challenges and many others, moving away from the monolithic blockchain structure of the past.
