To make easier your journey through this course, we have prepared a Starter Kit repo consisting of everything you will need to start developing your own custom blockchains on Dijets. This repo will provide a self-contained environment with Dijets-CLI, and Foundry so you can follow the course without the need of installing anything else other than launching the environment.

# What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following topics:

- How to launch your own Codespace
- Create your own Dijets InterECC Messaging enabled custom blockchain
- Foundry configuration

At the end of this section, you will have your environment ready to follow with the Cross-Chain development with Dijets InterECC Messaging.
