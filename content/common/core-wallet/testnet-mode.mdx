Since we do not want to play with real funds, we will switch to the Lothar Testnet, an exact replica of the Dijets's Mainnet architecture with the difference that its tokens are valueless.

To switch to Testnet Mode, open the Decypher browser extension, click on the burger menu, then Advanced, and finally activate Lothar Testnet Mode.
