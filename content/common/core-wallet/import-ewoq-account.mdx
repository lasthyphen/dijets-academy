The pre-funded address is an address where the private key is commonly known. It makes testing easier, since we can preconfigure the private key and don't have to create a new one every time.

**Address:** 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC

**Private Key:** 56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027

> Do not send any funds on any public blockchain to the pre-funded address. The funds will most likely be lost immediately.

To add the private key to your Decypher wallet, open the decypher extension and navigate to the `Account Manager`. Then click the `arrow button` and select `Import Private Key`.

There enter the private key and click on `Import Private Key`.

You can also change the account name. Click on the three dots, then `View Details` and then `edit` at the top right. 

> We highly recommend setting the name to something like `Do not use` to avoid accidentally using the pre-funded account for any real funds.
