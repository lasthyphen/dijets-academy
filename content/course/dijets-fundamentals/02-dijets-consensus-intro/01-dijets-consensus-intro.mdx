## What is Consensus
Consensus algorithm sets the rules that specify a variety of blockchain properties and procedures. These rules need to be followed when validating blocks and the transactions within them. As long as they are followed by the majority of nodes, agreement is retained and the whole operation continues. In order to reach consensus, the majority of nodes in a network must individually accept a single data value and they must do so unanimously. The majority must be in consensus, even if some of the nodes arenâ€™t observing the rules or are unreliable.

## Intro to Dijets Consensus
Dijets Consensus is an implementation of a leaderless, Byzantine fault tolerant protocol that exploits the metastability principle. The protocol builds upon and refines the sub-sampling method introduced by the gossip protocols and integrates advanced techniques such as adaptive sampling, robust sub-sampling, and enhanced validation mechanisms
Dijets Consensus is a novel consensus protocol that is used in the Dijets network. It is a leaderless, decentralized, and scalable consensus protocol that is used to achieve consensus on the state of the network.
