## Transfer an ERC-20 Token &rarr; Dijets ECC as an ERC-20 Token

This chapter will show you how to send an ERC-20 Token on Utility Chain to Dijets ECC using InterECC Messaging and Foundry. This demo is conducted on a local network, but can be applied to Lothar Testnet and Dijets Mainnet directly.

**All Dijets Interchain Token Transfer contracts and interfaces implemented in this chapter implementation are maintained in the [`dijets-interchain-token-transfer`](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/contracts/src) repository.**

Deep dives on each template interface can be found [here](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

_Disclaimer: The dijets-interchain-token-transfer contracts used in this tutorial are under active development and are not yet intended for production deployments. Use at your own risk._

## What we will do

1. Deploy an ERC-20 Contract on Utility Chain
2. Deploy the Interchain Token Transferer Contracts on Utility Chain and Dijets ECC
3. Register Remote Token contract with the Home Transferer contract
4. Add Collateral and Start Sending Tokens
