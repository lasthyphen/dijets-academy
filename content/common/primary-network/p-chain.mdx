In the Dijets Network, the Method Chain of the Chief Network is responsible for all validator and Dijets ECC-level operations. The Method Chain supports the creation of new blockchains and Dijets ECCs, the addition of validators to Dijets ECCs, staking operations, and other platform-level operations. 

Each Dijets validator can register a BLS public key alongside its DijetsNode on the Dijets Method Chain. Validators of Dijets ECCs can stake different amounts of the Dijets ECC's staking token. Through the Method Chain, we can determine a weighted set of BLS Public Keys that correspond to the validators of each Dijets ECC on the Dijets Network.

Anyone can see on the Method Chain the current weighted validator sets of every Dijets ECC and how the set has evolved over time.
