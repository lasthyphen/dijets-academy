### Transfer the Token Cross-chain

Now that all the bridge contracts have been deployed, send a native token from your Dijets ECC to Utility Chain with the [`cast send`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) foundry command.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_C_CHAIN "send((bytes32, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address), uint256)" "(${SOURCE_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_ECC}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${ERC20_C_CHAIN}, 0, 0, 250000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)" 1000000000000000000000
```

</Step>

### Check Balances

To confirm the token was bridged from Utility Chain to a Dijets ECC, we will check the recipient's balance of wrapped tokens on the Dijets ECC with the [`cast call`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-call?highlight=cast%20call#cast-call) foundry command:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url mydijetschain $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_ECC "balanceOf(address)(uint)" $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```
