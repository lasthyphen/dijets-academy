The Dijets Starter Kit contains everything you need to get started quickly with Dijets. Among other tools it contains Dijets CLI. With that you can set up a local network, create a Dijets Subnetwork, customize the Dijets Subnetwork/VM configuration, and so on. 

In this course we will run the Dijets Starter Kit in a hosted environment on Github. This is the most quick way to get started.

<Steps>

### Open the Dijets Starter Kit Github Repository:

<Link
    href=""
    className={cn(
    buttonVariants({ variant: 'default', className: 'mt-4' }),
    )}
    target='_blank'
>Open Dijets Starter Kit</Link>

</Step>

### Create a Codespace
- Click the green **Code** button
- Switch to the **Codespaces** tab
- Click **Create Codespace on main** or if you already have a Codespace click the plus (**+**) button

The Codespace will open in a new tab. Wait a few minutes until it's fully built.

</Step>

### Verify everything is working correctly

Open the terminal with `` Ctrl + ` `` or by opening it through the menu:

Now enter dijets -h to verify everything is working:

```bash
dijets -h
```

As a result you should see the help of Dijets CLI:

```
Dijets-CLI is a command-line tool that gives developers access to
everything Dijets. This release specializes in helping developers
build and test blockchains and ECCs running on Dijets

To get started, look at the documentation for the subcommands or jump right
in with dijets blockchain create myNewDijets Subnet.

Usage:
  dijets [command]

Available Commands:
  config                Modify configuration for Dijets-CLI
  help                  Help about any command
  key                   Create and manage testnet signing keys
```

</Step>

### Optional: Open Codespace locally in Visual Studio Code

You can switch any time from the browser IDE to Visual Studio Code:

The first time you switch, you will be asked to install the [Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) and connect VS Code to you GitHub account, if it is not already connceted.
