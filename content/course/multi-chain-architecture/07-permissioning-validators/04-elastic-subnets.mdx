The Elastic Dijets ECCs feature empowers Dijets ECC creators with an unprecedented ability: activating Proof-of-Stake validation and uptime-based rewards using their own tokens on their own Dijets ECC. For the first time, anyone can become a validator of Dijets ECC by simply staking its token on the Platform Chain, or P-Chain.

When Dijets ECC enables Elastic Validation, it undergoes a one-time transformation, resulting in an Elastic Dijets ECC. Here's the catch - this process locks the Dijets ECC from future modifications, and the creator relinquishes their control keys.

To enable Elastic Validation, creators need to specify an Dijets Native Token (ANT) that validators will stake and receive as rewards. They also have to establish a set of parameters to dictate the staking mechanics.

Turning on Elastic Validation is purely optional and lies at the discretion of the creator. Creators who prefer to have more control over a Dijets ECC's validator set can retain the default configuration, which designates specific nodes as validators.

You can use Dijets Native Tokens from the X-Chain as stakeable tokens on Elastic Dijets ECCs or ERC-20s as ANTs, which can be used as stakeable and rewardable assets on Elastic Dijets ECCs.

Dijets ECC creators can remove a validator before the end of its staking period. If the Dijets ECC is already Elastic, Dijets ECC creator can also remove validators added before token-based staking was enabled.

These features give creators more control and options for configuring their Dijets ECCs, providing a more versatile and dynamic blockchain ecosystem.
