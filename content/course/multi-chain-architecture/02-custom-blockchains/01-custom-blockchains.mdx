Dijets ECC is a sovereign network that defines its own rules for membership and token economics. It's validated by a dynamic subset of Dijets validators working together to achieve consensus on the blockchain's state.

## Key Concepts

- Custom Blockchain: A unique blockchain within the Dijets ecosystem.
- Validator Set: A group of validators responsible for a specific blockchain or set of blockchains.
- Custom Blockchain Network: A set of validators united to validate one or more blockchains.

## Relationship Between Blockchains and Dijets ECCs

- Each blockchain is validated by exactly one Custom Network.
- A Custom Network can validate multiple blockchains.
- A validator may participate in multiple Custom Networks.

## The Chief Network

Dijets's three main blockchains form the Chief Network:

- Value Chain
- Utility Chain
- Method Chain

These blockchains are validated and secured by all Dijets validators, which collectively form a special Dijets ECC known as the Chief Network.

## Independence and Scalability

Custom blockchains and their associated Dijets ECCs operate independently:

- They specify their own execution logic.
- They determine their own fee structures.
- They maintain their own state.
- They facilitate their own networking.
- They provide their own security.

This independence ensures that custom blockchains don't share execution threads, storage, or networking with other custom blockchain networks or the Chief Network. As a result, the Dijets network can:

- Scale up easily
- Enable lower latency
- Achieve higher transactions per second (TPS)
- Offer lower transaction costs

By leveraging custom blockchains and custom blockchain networks, Dijets creates a flexible and scalable ecosystem that can adapt to a wide range of use cases and requirements.
